# BCG Data Science & Advanced Analytics Virtual Experience Program Submission

## Executive Summary

### Context
PowerCo, a leading gas and electricity provider, faces a customer retention challenge within the SME segment due to the deregulation of the European energy market. Collaborating with BCG, the goal was to uncover the drivers behind SME customer churn.

### Problem
The deregulation has intensified competition, resulting in a noticeable increase in churn, particularly among SMEs.

### Analysis
We hypothesized that churn could be attributed to price sensitivity and that predictive modeling could identify customers at risk of leaving. However, the proposed strategy of offering a 20% discount to those with a 75% or greater chance of churning was deemed financially unsustainable, consuming approximately 11% of annual revenue.

### Insights
The Random Forest Classification Model revealed that churn is multifaceted, influenced not only by price but also by other factors such as forecasted power prices, consumption history, energy prices, subscribed power, initial campaign subscriptions, and forecasted meter rental bills. This complexity suggests that a blanket discount strategy is insufficient and potentially costly.

### Recommendations
To mitigate churn, PowerCo should adopt a multifaceted approach that includes:
- **Churn Prediction**: Implement marketing analytics to detect imminent churn behaviors.
- **Customer Value Focus**: Tailor retention strategies to different customer segments, prioritizing the most valuable.
- **Personalization**: Enhance customer engagement through personalized interactions and recommendations.
- **Cancellation Management**: Employ skilled agents to handle cancellation requests, leveraging personal touch to retain customers.
- **Community Engagement**: Foster a customer community for support, feedback, and loyalty building.
- **Surprise and Delight**: Introduce targeted incentives for at-risk customers to foster loyalty and reduce churn rates.

This comprehensive strategy prioritizes understanding and addressing the unique needs and behaviors of PowerCo's customers, leveraging data science not just to predict churn but to inform actionable, customer-centric retention strategies.
